### Hi, I'm Adam 👋

I am a quantitative research associate working with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland Maine. 

I work primarily in the R programming language, but have learned to become less of a tidyverse zealot and have welcomed python and Jupyter notebooks into my life for some of my current projects. I enjoy using programming tools like shiny to tell the stories of data around fisheries and climate change. I see a lot of value in giving the audience an opportunity to explore their own questions with the available information, as I believe it fosters better understanding.

I'm currently working on [projects](https://github.com/adamkemberling/continuous_plankton_recorder) using the Continuous Plankton Recorder [CPR](https://www.cprsurvey.org/) datasets for the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions, and incorporating remotely sensed data products like [NOAA's OISST dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst) in addition to the [NERACOOS Buoy Array](http://www.neracoos.org/realtime_map).

My research interests are in modeling how a changing marine environment impacts habitat use and community compositions across the world's oceans. I really enjoy the opportunity to explore these questions, and the challenges and nuance that they bring with them.
