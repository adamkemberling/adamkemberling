### Hi, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

I am a quantitative research associate working with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland Maine. I work in the Integrated Systems Ecology Lab led by Dr. Kathy Mills focusing on the distillation of complex ocean data to understand how the mix of these components affects the ecosystem, fisheries, and coastal communities. I also track the sea surface patterns in the [Gulf of Maine.](https://adamkemberling.github.io/oisst_mainstays/R/markdown_reports/GOM_Seasonal_Update.html)

I work primarily in the R programming language, but have learned to become less of a tidyverse zealot and have welcomed python and Jupyter notebooks into my life for some of my current projects. I enjoy using programming tools like shiny and Rmarkdown to tell the stories of data around fisheries and climate change. I see a lot of value in giving the audience an opportunity to explore their own questions with the available information, as I believe it fosters better understanding.

I'm currently working on [projects](https://github.com/adamkemberling/continuous_plankton_recorder) using the Continuous Plankton Recorder [CPR](https://www.cprsurvey.org/) datasets for the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions, and incorporating remotely sensed data products like [NOAA's OISST dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst) in addition to the [NERACOOS Buoy Array](http://www.neracoos.org/realtime_map). I also [investigate spatio-temporal patterns](https://adamkemberling.github.io/nefsc_trawl/R/nmfs_size_spectra/size_spectrum_story.html) in fish populations sampled by Federal fisheries-independent surveys.

My research interests are in modeling how a changing marine environment impacts habitat use and community compositions across the world's oceans. I really enjoy the opportunity to explore these questions, and the challenges and nuance that they bring with them.
